intro_text: There are inherent risks whenever we invest, divest, or hold our
  assets, and wherever we operate.

    writeup: We adopt a long term view of our investments, with the flexibility to
      take concentrated positions. We invest across all stages of a business
      life cycle, from early stage and/or unlisted, to large or listed assets.
      We do not have predefined concentration limits, or targets for investing
      by asset class, country, sector, theme or single name.

      Our long investment horizon means we have a portfolio of predominantly
      equities, including unlisted assets and private equity funds, designed to
      deliver higher risk-adjusted returns over the long term.


      Consequently, our portfolio is expected to have higher year-to-year volatility of annual returns, with higher risks of negative returns in any one year.


      Our investment posture is to ride out such short term market volatility, and focus on generating sustainable returns over the long term.

      take concentrated positions.

    writeup: Given the expected volatility, we manage our leverage and liquidity
      prudently for resilience and investment flexibility, even in times of
      extreme stress.

      balanced risk taking. This applies to both our investment activities and
