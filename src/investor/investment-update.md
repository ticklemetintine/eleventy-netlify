      We had a very active year despite COVID-19. During the financial year
      ended 31 March 2021, we invested S$49 billion and divested S$39 billion:
      record numbers on both counts.


      Some of our large investments helped enable our portfolio companies to reposition for the post-COVID world. We continued to deploy capital into opportunities that were aligned with [our focus on long term trends](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/how-we-invest.html). Some technology trends, like digitisation, have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also realised gains from divestments based on our intrinsic value tests.


      The transition towards low carbon economies and sustainable lifestyles is not only an imperative, but also presents us with new investment opportunities. We have [increased our focus](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/pathways-to-sustainability/investing-for-impact-and-returns.html) on businesses with innovative products, services and business models that drive [decarbonisation](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/media-centre/forging-pathways-to-decarbonisation.html), resource efficiencies, and material and process innovation. We have also forged novel partnerships with other investors who are committed to achieving a [net zero world](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/overview/towards-a-net-zero-world.html) to scale feasible novel energy solutions, mobility, the built environment and manufacturing sectors.

      ability) considerations are integral to our investment decision-making
      processes. This enhances our existing investment practices, supports our
      investment decision making, and safeguards Temasekâ€™s reputation. It is
      well aligned with our objective of generating sustainable returns, by
      investing with a long term view, and frames our engagement with our
      portfolio companies and fund managers on sustainability priorities."

      We continually evolve and strengthen our ESG framework. Our ESG Investment
      Management team is now an integral part of our Portfolio Strategy and Risk
      Group. This is a key step in our journey to integrate and advance ESG
      considerations across all of our global investments.


      We moved decisively on the contribution and exposure to climate change from our investments. We incorporated an initial [carbon pricing](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/pathways-to-sustainability/putting-a-price-on-carbon.html) of US$42 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in our investment analyses. This pilot helped to guide decision making in line with broader climate targets and model the likely future impact of carbon pricing on the investments we make. We expect to increase the cost each year through to 2030, in tandem with our ambition to deliver on our [carbon abatement targets](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/pathways-to-sustainability/measuring-and-tracking-portfolio-emissions.html).


      In addition to our direct investments, we have engaged the managers of the private equity funds and credit funds, to review the alignment of their focus with our ESG stance as well as the maturity of their ESG practices. The assessment will inform our future engagement with these fund managers and other like-minded investors, to promote ESG practices and reporting for funds.


      We are continually building our ESG capabilities across the firm. Our investment professionals are required to fulfil training on our methodologies and processes. Their analyses are supported by a network of ESG champions and a team of dedicated ESG professionals.
