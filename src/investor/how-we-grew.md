title: How We Grew
intro_text: We grew with Singapore in our early years. In 2002, we stepped out
  to build a second wing of growth with a transforming Asia. We have since
  increased our exposure outside Asia to capture global opportunities for
  innovation and sustainable solutions.

  Our [initial portfolio in
  1974](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/overview/temasek-portfolio-at-inception.html)
  reflected Singapore's early stages of industrialisation. Some of these
  companies, and others added since, have grown into iconic Singapore brands,
  such as [DBS](https://www.dbs.com.sg/) and the [Singapore
  Zoo](https://www.wrs.com.sg/en/singapore-zoo.html). Others, like
  [Singtel](https://www.singtel.com/), [Singapore
  Airlines](https://www.singaporeair.com/) and
  [PSA](https://www.globalpsa.com/), have transformed into regional and global
  champions.


  In recent years, we have focused on trends driven by technological advances that cater to demographic shifts and sustainability objectives, change business models, or shift consumption patterns.


  We continue to seek innovative companies that create new opportunities through innovative and sometimes disruptive solutions.


  As at 31 March 2021, our [net portfolio value](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/overview/performance-overview.html) was S$381 billion.
