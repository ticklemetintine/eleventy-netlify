      writeup: "Equity returns are volatile over time, and influenced by macroeconomic
        or geopolitical events and shocks. Hence, T-GEM uses a scenario-based
        approach to simulate our 20-year long term expected returns. This
        approach takes into account our views of long term macroeconomic
        fundamentals over the next 20 years, adjusted for current market
        valuations. "
