      writeup: "Equity returns are volatile over time, and influenced by macroeconomic
        or geopolitical events and shocks. Hence, T-GEM uses a scenario-based
        approach to simulate our 20-year long term expected returns. This
        approach takes into account our views of long term macroeconomic
        fundamentals over the next 20 years, adjusted for current market
        valuations. "

    - writeup: "In projecting economic fundamentals, we make more granular
        year-to-year assumptions for the first five years, and transit to more
        general assumptions based on longer term fundamentals as we go beyond 10
        years. This &ldquo;pathing&rdquo; approach incorporates assumptions
        about changes in economic conditions over time. We do not assume an
        equilibrium return that remains unchanged over the 20-year period, nor
        do we assume a reversion to the historical mean. "

    The charts below illustrate the simulated returns for a <span
    class="tooltip" title="The Global Bond Portfolio uses government bonds
    within the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate as a proxy." data-title="The
    Global Bond Portfolio uses government bonds within the Bloomberg Barclays
    Global Aggregate as a proxy.">Global Bond Portfolio</span>, a <span
    class="tooltip" title="The Global Equity Portfolio uses the MSCI ACWI as a
    proxy." data-title="The Global Equity Portfolio uses the MSCI ACWI as a
    proxy.">Global Equity Portfolio</span> and the Temasek Portfolio. The
    simulations are based on our Central Scenario.


    The Global Bond Portfolio has the lowest upside potential, as compared to the Global Equity and Temasek Portfolios. It also has the least volatility, as shown by its narrower year-to-year annual returns distribution curve. 


    The Temasek Portfolio has the highest upside potential (see blue shaded) at the end of the 20-year period, but also the highest volatility.

  title: "20-year Expected Returns for Various Temasek Scenarios "
  quicklink_id: twenty-year-expected-returns-scenarios
  writeup_before: "We simulate our 20-year expected returns under different scenarios. "
  writeup_after: >-
    The T-GEM 20-year returns curves for the Temasek Portfolio are shown below
    for the Central, Differing Climate Change Pathways, China Hard Landing,
    Severe Escalation in Trade and Tech Tensions, and Secular Stagnation
    Scenarios.


    Broadly, the Central Scenario offers higher 20-year expected returns for the Temasek Portfolio, compared to those under the other alternate scenarios. The exception is the High Ambition Climate Change Scenario, where there is concerted effort and strong actions to mitigate climate change and carbon emissions, for a more liveable world.
