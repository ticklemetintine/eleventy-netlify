title: How We Invest
intro_text: We work to deliver sustainable value over the long term as an active
  investor and an engaged owner.
before_writeup: >-
  Our investment philosophy has been guided by [four long term investment
  themes](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/what-we-do/how-we-invest) that encompass
  Transforming Economies; Growing Middle Income Populations; Deepening
  Comparative Advantages; and Emerging Champions.


  In applying these themes, we look at investments through the lens of key structural trends, to shape our long term portfolio construction and guide our investment activities. Over the year, we refreshed our thinking and sharpened our investment focus for the coming years, along four structural trends:

      many sectors. Future of Consumption and Longer Lifespans reflect
      structural shifts in consumption patterns and growing needs of longevity.

      We expect to increasingly [shape our
      portfolio](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/investment-update.html)
      in line with such trends. This includes deeper engagements with our
      portfolio companies to identify threats and relevant transformation
      opportunities. We also invest in companies that are [developing innovative
      solutions](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/investment-update.html#investment-highlights)
      to disrupt current business models or create new ones.


      We aim to build a [forward looking and resilient portfolio](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/pathways-to-sustainability/investing-for-impact-and-returns.html) that can deliver sustainable and equitable economic growth, and enable the transition to a low carbon economy. We deploy capital to [catalyse innovations and solutions](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/investment-update.html#catalysing-innovative-solutions) to benefit this and future generations.

      Our [Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
      framework](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/sustainability/mainstreaming-sustainability)
      helps us identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities in the
      investments we make and the portfolio we own. It also supports our
      ambition to halve the [net carbon emissions of our
      portfolio](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/pathways-to-sustainability/measuring-and-tracking-portfolio-emissions.html)
      over 2010 levels by 2030, and to achieve net zero carbon emissions by
      2050.


      The transitions to low carbon and digital economies will bring about fundamental changes to businesses and jobs, and give rise to new challenges, such as data privacy. We work to enable fair and just transitions that care for the interests of employees and partners along the supply and value chain.


      Decent jobs, diverse and inclusive workplaces are foundational to [resilient communities](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/steward/touching-lives.html). We encourage portfolio companies in their efforts to upskill and reskill their workforce.


      Robust corporate governance includes the purpose of a company and the values of its people, the role and makeup of boards of directors, the rights of shareholders and the interest of stakeholders, and the balance between short term and long term performance measurement. These are essential underpinnings of a [forward looking and resilient institution](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/institution/a-forward-looking-institution.html).

      Our [investment
      discipline](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/institution/financial-discipline.html)
      focuses on intrinsic value and our [risk-return
      framework](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/how-we-manage-risks.html#organisational-risk-management-framework).
      This risk-return framework drives our investment focus, capital
      allocation, performance measurement and [incentive
      system](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/institution/instilling-ownership.html).


      For each investment we make, we conduct bottom-up intrinsic value tests, with [expected returns evaluated against a risk-adjusted cost of capital](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/total-shareholder-return.html). This risk-adjusted cost of capital is derived using a capital asset pricing model. Investments in riskier sectors or markets have higher costs of capital. We use risk-adjusted cost of capital to normalise the risks in order to compare the relative attractiveness among investment opportunities.


      We also include a current internal [carbon price](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/pathways-to-sustainability/putting-a-price-on-carbon.html) of US$42 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e ), to assess the possible climate transition impact and to further guide our investment decisions.


      From 1 April 2021, we have started adding an illiquidity risk premium to our cost of capital for unlisted investments, and a venture risk premium to our cost of capital for early stage investments.

      We have full flexibility as an owner and investor to [reshape and
      rebalance our
      portfolio](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/investment-update.html#investment-highlights),
      whenever opportunities or challenges arise. We are predominantly invested
      in equities. Based on our risk-return appetite, we invest or divest in
      line with [our outlook and value
      tests](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/investor/20-year-returns-outlook.html).
      We may take concentrated positions or remain in cash, and do not set
      limits for asset classes, countries or sectors. We manage our liquidity
      and balance sheet for resilience.


      We are an active shareholder, seeking to add or create value in our portfolio across all stages of enterprise growth, from early stage to mature companies. We proactively promote [good governance](https://www.temasekreview.com.sg/steward/a-trusted-steward.html#relating-portfolio-companies), looking to boards to drive strategy and oversee management, who, in turn, run their respective companies.


      The [Portfolio Development function](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/news-room/news/2019/focus-on-strategic-priorities-and-building-new-capabilities), which was established last year, works together with our major portfolio companies to enhance value through partnerships, innovation, growth strategies and transformational possibilities.


      Our portfolio comprises both listed and unlisted assets, including investments in funds. Mature, Singapore-based companies such as [Mapletree](https://www.mapletree.com.sg/), [PSA](https://www.globalpsa.com/) and [SP Group](https://www.spgroup.com.sg/) make up just over a third of our unlisted portfolio. Investments in private equity and credit funds have been instrumental in helping us gain deeper insights into new markets or sub-sectors of specialisation, and have provided co-investment opportunities. They make up just over a quarter of our unlisted portfolio. Other private companies such as [Ant Financial](https://www.antgroup.com/en), [Ceva Sant√© Animale](https://www.ceva.com/en), [Global Healthcare Exchange](https://www.ghx.com/), [GoTo Group](https://www.gotocompany.com/), [Haldor Topsoe](https://www.topsoe.com/), [Schneider Electric India Private Limited](https://www.se.com/in/en), [Verily Life Sciences](https://verily.com/), [Watsons](https://www.aswatson.com/) and WuXi AppTec, also make up about a quarter of our unlisted portfolio.


      We have made selective investments in early stage companies which provide us with insights into innovation in technology and business models. This enables us to better assess future opportunities and segments, and understand potential implications for our broader portfolio, while potentially delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns. Early stage investments make up less than 10% of our unlisted portfolio today.


      Our unlisted portfolio is a source of steady dividends and distributions. Over the last 10 years, our unlisted portfolio has generated returns of over 10% per annum.

    writeup: From time to time, we may express our interest to invest or divest
      selected positions or manage our portfolio through derivatives. We may
      also use derivatives to hedge currency and/or protect against potential
      losses of our underlying investments, where gains and losses of the
      derivatives are matched against corresponding losses and gains in the
      underlying investments.
    highlight: We manage our liquidity and balance sheet for resilience.
