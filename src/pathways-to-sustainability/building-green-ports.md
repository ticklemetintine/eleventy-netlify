title: Building Green Ports
main_content:
  - writeup: >-
      Port operator [PSA International (PSA)](https://www.globalpsa.com/) is on
      a mission to halve its absolute carbon emissions by 2030 and be carbon
      neutral by 2050. To this end, they are rolling out a series of green
      initiatives across its portfolio of terminals, logistics and marine assets
      in some 30 countries.


      To reduce direct emissions, PSA is switching from diesel-powered equipment to lower carbon options such as electric yard cranes and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). It is working to reduce electricity consumption and is tapping on renewable energy sources by installing solar power systems and purchasing green electricity sourced from wind and hydropower. PSA has also been test bedding new decarbonisation technologies to accelerate their development and deployment in the port sector. A smart grid, supported by battery energy storage systems and artificial intelligence, is also being introduced to optimise energy use.
