      Sustainability and climate change are mega forces that will shape every
      facet of our society for decades to come. Many now regard climate change
      as a global emergency.


      The collective response is accelerating. This is necessary, but not yet sufficient to keep the average global temperature increase to [less than 1.5 degrees Celsius](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) above pre-industrial levels.


      Broader concerns are coalescing around related issues of air pollution, water conservation, the collapse of ecosystems, waste, plastic pollution, and ethical supply chains.

      The nexus between climate risks and business viability is becoming
      clearer. A more liveable and equitable future goes hand in hand with long
      term opportunities and returns.


      At Temasek, doing well, doing right and doing good are inseparable, as we strive to activate capital &mdash; [financial](/overview/our-financials-and-portfolio.html), [human](/overview/onetemasek-our-people.html), [natural ](/overview/towards-a-net-zero-world.html)and [social](/overview/uplifting-lives-and-communities.html) &mdash; to catalyse solutions for a better world, and deliver sustainable long term returns. Sustainability is at the core of everything we do.

      term opportunities and returns. "
