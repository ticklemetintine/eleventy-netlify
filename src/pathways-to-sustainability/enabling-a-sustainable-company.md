title: Enabling a Sustainable Company
intro_text: "Sustainability is at the core of what we do: a part of who we are,
  and our emphasis to do well, do right, and do good. Measuring and managing our
  environmental footprint remains a major enabler for change. "
before_chart: >-
  We empower our employees to advocate for change and build a sustainable
  ecosystem across our portfolio and partners across business, government and
  civil society.


  We had set and achieved our target of carbon neutrality as a company two years ago, and have maintained this status. While Scope 3 indirect emissions relating to our operations have decreased, particularly due to COVID-related restrictions on business travel, we have progressed our plans to further reduce our emissions and resource use.


  In particular, we initiated an assessment of the potential to further reduce Scope 2 indirect emissions from our headquarters in Singapore, including the possibility of generating renewable energy using on-site solar panels.


  At the company operations level, we track the use of electricity, which is a source of our Scope 2 indirect emissions; business travel, corporate events and other activities which add to our Scope 3 indirect emissions; water consumption and paper usage. We have negligible Scope 1 direct carbon emitting activities. These form part of our environmental footprint.
