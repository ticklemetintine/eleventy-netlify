title: Investing for Impact and Returns
intro_text: We have stepped up our efforts to invest in carbon avoidance
  opportunities, such as renewable energy and plant-based proteins. We look for
  carbon negative solutions, such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage
  (CCUS), as and when these become feasible.

      On the climate and carbon front, we have a three-pronged approach:

      1. Investing in climate-aligned opportunities;
      2. Enabling carbon negative solutions; and
      3. Encouraging decarbonisation efforts in businesses.

    title: Investing in Climate-Aligned Opportunities
    writeup: >-
      We actively sought investments with track records of better carbon
      intensity and efficiency. For example, we invested in [Eavor
      Technologies](https://eavor.com/), a company that develops technology to
      harvest geothermal energy; and Svante which specialises in low cost carbon
      capture technology.


      More importantly, however, we are also prepared to work with companies to support their own decarbonisation journeys. These mitigate [climate change](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/) with clear transition pathways.


      Our [partnership with BlackRock](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/news-room/news/2021/temasek-blackrock-launch-decarbonization-partnership), Decarbonization Partners, aims to advance decarbonisation for a net zero carbon economy by 2050. An initial funding of US$600 million from BlackRock and Temasek will help launch a series of late stage venture capital and early growth private equity investment funds to crowd in investments for companies and technologies that will reduce or eliminate carbon emissions.

      As a member of the [Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon
      Markets](https://www.iif.com/tsvcm), a multi-national private sector
      initiative, we work to enable a more transparent and liquid carbon offset
      trading market at scale. This is one critical infrastructure to facilitate
      more investments in robust emissions abatement projects for a net zero
      world.


      [Climate Impact X (CIX)](https://www.climateimpactx.com/) is our joint venture with [DBS](https://www.dbs.com.sg/), [Standard Chartered](https://www.sc.com/) and the [Singapore Exchange (SGX)](https://www.sgx.com/), a global exchange and marketplace for high quality carbon credits. Announced in May 2021, CIX will focus initially on catalysing the market for nature-based solutions, such as the protection and restoration of forests, wetlands and mangroves. Technologies such as satellite monitoring, machine learning and blockchain technology, will enhance the transparency, integrity and quality of such carbon credits.


      To complement this initiative, we have partnered DBS, [Google](https://www.google.com/), [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), [Verra](https://verra.org/) and the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/), to launch the [Sustaintech Xcelerator](https://www.sustaintechx.com/). This supports climate innovators who are developing solutions to improve monitoring and verification of the environmental, social, and economic impacts for evidence-based nature solutions.


      We funded research led by the [NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions](https://www.nus.edu.sg/cncs/) to understand how <span class="tooltip tooltipstered" data-title="Carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrass.">
                              blue carbon</span> can mitigate climate change in Southeast Asia. This research will develop a knowledge database of blue carbon stocks in the region and a toolkit for better monitoring, reporting and verification.
