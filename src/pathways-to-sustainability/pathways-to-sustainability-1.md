title: Investing for Impact and Returns
intro_text: We have stepped up our efforts to invest in carbon avoidance
  opportunities, such as renewable energy and plant-based proteins. We look for
  carbon negative solutions, such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage
  (CCUS), as and when these become feasible.

    writeup: |-
      On the climate and carbon front, we have a three-pronged approach:

      1. Investing in climate-aligned opportunities;
      2. Enabling carbon negative solutions; and
      3. Encouraging decarbonisation efforts in businesses.
