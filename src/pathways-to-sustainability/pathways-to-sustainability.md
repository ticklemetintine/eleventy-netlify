      COVID-19 has shown that we can address this with forward looking policies
      and pre-emptive actions by governments, bold innovation & investment by
      businesses, and behavioural change by us all. It has also made it clear
      that we need to tackle such challenges together â€” no one is safe until
      everyone is safe.


      The nub of the [climate emergency](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/) is the externalisation of the future costs of carbon emissions. This is further clouded by the long lag between actions and results, the tragedy of horizons.
