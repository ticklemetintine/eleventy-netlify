      COVID-19 has shown that we can address this with forward looking policies
      and pre-emptive actions by governments, bold innovation & investment by
      businesses, and behavioural change by us all. It has also made it clear
      that we need to tackle such challenges together â€” no one is safe until
      everyone is safe.


      The nub of the [climate emergency](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/) is the externalisation of the future costs of carbon emissions. This is further clouded by the long lag between actions and results, the tragedy of horizons.

      Carbon pricing internalises the economic and social costs of carbon
      emissions, such as the increasingly negative consequences to liveability.
      The impact is wide-ranging, from acute risks such as extreme weather
      events, to chronic risks such as rising sea levels. As a result, the
      viability of businesses and economies will be impacted. Carbon prices may
      need to surpass US$100 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) by
      2030 to drive effective decarbonisation and deliver on the Paris
      Agreement.


      We have set an initial internal carbon price of US$42 per tCO2e to inform our investment decisions. A portion of our long term incentives will be aligned with our 10-year carbon targets.

    writeup: We will refine our carbon pricing strategies during this coming decade,
      likely with increasing internal carbon pricing, as we get further clarity
      on the economic and policy levers of change.
