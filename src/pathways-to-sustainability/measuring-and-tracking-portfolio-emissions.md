title: Measuring and Tracking Portfolio Emissions
intro_text: >-
  Last year, we committed to reducing the net carbon emissions
    attributable to our portfolio to half the 2010 levels by <span class="tooltip
    tooltipstered" data-title="The target has been established in reference to the
    latest scientific assessments (AR5) published by the Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change (IPCC).">2030</span>. We also signalled our ambitions for
    net zero carbon emissions by <span class="tooltip tooltipstered"
    data-title="Due to differences in the calendar year and our financial year,
    calendar year emissions data and targets are reported in the subsequent
    financial year.">2050</span>.

  This journey is not without challenges. Not least is the inherent limitations
  of data availability, timeliness and consistency. The latest datasets for some
  portfolio companies date back to pre-COVID times. This challenge is even more
  pronounced as we look back to 2010, and as we look ahead to estimate the size
  of our ambition by 2030.


  Nonetheless, we will initiate the annual reporting of the carbon emissions of our equities portfolio. In September 2020, Temasek became a supporter of the recommendations of the [Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/), as part of our journey.


  On the basis of more refined company-level data and sub industry-level proxies, we have updated our estimates of the carbon emission attributable to our portfolio in the financial year ended 31 March 2011, as shown in the chart below.
