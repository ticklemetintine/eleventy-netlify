title: Collaborating for Progress
intro_text: We work with a growing list of like-minded partners, to catalyse
  ideas for an *abc World* of **a**ctive and productive economies, **b**eautiful
  and inclusive societies, and a **c**lean, cool Earth.

  Our annual *[Ecosperity](https://www.ecosperity.sg/)* conference, first held
  in 2014, promotes the twinning of ecology and prosperity for sustainable
  growth. It brings together key decision makers, such as business leaders,
  policymakers, investors and civil society, to share insights and best
  practices on sustainable development.


  The planned conference last year was postponed due to the pandemic. Instead, we instituted an online series of *Ecosperity* Conversations with our portfolio companies and a wide group of stakeholders. Highlights for the year included sessions on biodiversity and ecosystem services, nature-based solutions, and integrated services for sustainable districts.


  We actively participate in investor and business networks that share our common vision of a future that provides equal opportunity and prosperity for all.


  As a member of the [Green Finance Industry Task Force](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/accelerating-green-finance) under the Monetary Authority of Singaporeâ€™s [Financial Centre Advisory Panel](https://www.mas.gov.sg/who-we-are/MAS-Advisory-Panels-and-Committees/financial-centre-advisory-panel), we shared our recommendations to establish Singapore as a green finance node.


  We are a member of the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/), the [Focusing Capital on the Long Term Initiative](https://www.fcltglobal.org/) and the [Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)](https://www.sasb.org/). We work with them and others to promote responsible investing. In order to promote increased sustainability-related disclosures among listed companies, for example, we have partnered SASB and [SGX](https://www.sgx.com/) to host awareness sessions for SGX-listed company boards and senior management.


  We also engage with forward thinking partners to promote investing for sustainability and impact, through forums such as the [Global Impact Investing Network](https://thegiin.org/).
