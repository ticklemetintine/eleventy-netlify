Widgets define the data type and interface for entry fields. Netlify CMS comes with several built-in widgets. Click the widget names in the sidebar to jump to specific widget details. Weâ€™re always adding new widgets, and you can also create your own!

Widgets are specified as collection fields in the Netlify CMS config.yml file. Note that YAML syntax allows lists and objects to be written in block or inline style, and the code samples below include a mix of both.

To see working examples of all of the built-in widgets, try making a 'Kitchen Sink' collection item on the CMS demo site. (No login required: click the login button and the CMS will open.) You can refer to the demo configuration code to see how each field was configured.
