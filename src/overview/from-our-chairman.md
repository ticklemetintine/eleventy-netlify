      Successive waves of COVID-19 outbreaks peaked higher and higher, for most
      of 2020 and well into the first half of 2021. Lives and livelihoods were
      devastated around the world. The unexpected early successes of COVID-19
      vaccines offered a ray of hope, clouded by production capacity
      constraints. However, the more infectious new variants of concern are now
      threatening to outpace vaccination deliveries.


      Even as Temasek shouldered its part in [various pandemic initiatives](http://localhost/steward/rising-above-covid-19.html), we kept a full agenda as an [investor, institution and steward](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/who-we-are/our-charter).


      Looking ahead, we expect policymakers to remain accommodative. [Global growth may touch 6% in 2021 after the -3.3% decline in 2020](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/03/23/world-economic-outlook-april-2021).


      The pandemic has exacerbated the ongoing US-China strategic rivalry. This geopolitical uncertainty will be a drag on the investment climate and economic confidence.


      Other longer term global threats have not gone away. The window is closing rapidly on the carbon abatement front. We are [nearing the tipping point](http://localhost/pathways-to-sustainability/towards-a-sustainable-future.html) for melting glaciers.


      Our world has changed. It is not a sustainable option to bounce back to “business as usual”. We must all pull together, and bounce *forward* into a new norm for better lives and more sustainable livelihoods.


      The world came together to deliver solutions to the pandemic threat, however untidy the politics and fractious the nationalistic urges. We can and must do the same to [reduce carbon emissions](http://localhost/pathways-to-sustainability/measuring-and-tracking-portfolio-emissions.html), and improve food, water, energy and waste management.


      Temasek can work to catalyse solutions to key global challenges. We will deploy *[financial capital](http://localhost/overview/our-financials-and-portfolio.html)* to stimulate innovation and growth; develop *[human capital](http://localhost/overview/onetemasek-our-people.html)* to uplift capabilities and enhance potential; enable *[natural capital](http://localhost/overview/towards-a-net-zero-world.html)* to foster sustainable solutions for the climate and a better living environment; and crowd in *[social capital](http://localhost/overview/uplifting-lives-and-communities.html)* to transform lives for a more inclusive and resilient world.

      As at 31 March 2021, our [net portfolio value](http://localhost/overview/performance-overview.html) was S$381 billion, up S$75 billion over the previous year. Our portfolio saw healthy investment returns, including from payments, technology and life sciences, especially in markets like China and the US. In addition, several of our unlisted companies went public as markets rebounded.

      One-year [Total Shareholder Return (TSR)](http://localhost/investor/total-shareholder-return.html) was 24.53%. Our longer term 10-year and 20-year TSRs were 7% and 8% respectively. [TSR since inception in 1974](http://localhost/investor/how-we-grew.html) was 14%.


      The resilience of our portfolio remains a core strength. We invested through the year, to strengthen our portfolio against a more disruptive world. We expect that rapid technological changes will upend business models, with climate risks becoming more pressing.

      It is adversity that brings out the strengths and values of our people.


      I am immensely proud that our staff have volunteered tirelessly, thoughtfully and selflessly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their efforts have helped people keep safe and cope in these trying times.


      Temasek actively enabled various cross-border COVID-19 initiatives. During the first outbreak in Wuhan early last year, we facilitated the provision of equipment and supplies to China. Later, we supported the reverse flow of critical supplies from China to various places in dire need, including [most recently to India](http://localhost/steward/rising-above-covid-19.html#enablement).

      Our staff worked closely with colleagues from [Temasek Foundation](https://www.temasekfoundation.org.sg/) and other partners to [support COVID-19 initiatives in five key areas](http://localhost/steward/rising-above-covid-19.html): testing & diagnosis, containment & contact tracing, care & treatment, protection & prevention, and enablement. They brought their skills and knowledge, networks and organisational experience, friendship and goodwill, and tenacity and persistence, to connect people, find solutions, and make things happen.

      Indeed, several staff were on the swabbing frontlines supporting the testing and sorting operations for migrant workers in the dormitories, to protect them and contain the massive dormitory outbreak. Others quietly helped to keep supply lines open, or supported other initiatives.


      Initiatives in diagnosis ranged from new test kits to be developed, to production to be scaled; from expanding lab capacity in Singapore, to supporting lab capabilities beyond; from seeding novel wastewater sampling testing, to stepping up lab automation for throughput, safety and capacity. Some 6,300 kits for over 1 million diagnostic tests, and various lab equipment, were donated to over 40 countries in Asia and elsewhere.


      An early initiative in containment was the pre-emptive development of Community Care Facilities for younger “Walking Well” patients with mild or no symptoms — these greatly relieved the pressure on hospital beds. Other efforts in containment & contract tracing included pilots in Singapore like the mass community COVID-19 screening of some 5,700 hawkers, cleaners, and retail workers; and the use of the Antigen Rapid Test to pre-screen large scale events like the Singapore International Energy Week; as well as various contact tracing solutions.

      While Temasek is not on the frontlines of treatment, we worked proactively with Temasek Foundation to support communities and hospitals around the region, as well as further afield in Latin America and the Middle East. Donations ranged from oximeters, oxygen concentrators, and BiPAP positive airway pressure machines, to ICU-grade ventilators and ECMO “artificial lung” machines. More recently, we facilitated the rapid supply of cryogenic tanks and donated more oxygen-related equipment to India, during their massive outbreak in the second quarter of 2021.

      The mainstays for protection & prevention are personal protective equipment, or PPEs, and hand sanitisers. These saw massive shortages last year.


      We supported Temasek Foundation through four nationwide exercises for Singapore residents to collect over 30 million [free reusable, washable, antiviral, and antibacterial face masks](https://stayprepared.sg/staymasked/). Regional PPE donations ranged from reusable or single use masks for the community, to hospital grade items such as full protection hazmat suits and N95 respirators, to gowns, gloves, goggles and others.


      The [\#BYOBclean](https://stayprepared.sg/byobclean/) pilot, launched in March last year, encouraged families to “Bring Your Own Bottles”, clean and ready to collect their free allocation of hand sanitiser. This was followed by a second nationwide free collection in April this year. Regional partners helped us cover Johor and the Riau Islands nearby. In all, more than 1.3 million litres of hand sanitiser were distributed for free, including to hospitals, residential care homes, and migrant workers.


      Reusable mask distributions and #BYOBclean programmes also serve as reminders to reduce plastic waste.


      Our portfolio companies also played their part. During the second half of 2020, Temasek Foundation [worked with Singapore Airlines to sponsor flights for the World Food Programme](https://www.temasekfoundation.org.sg/media/singapore-airlines-and-temasek-foundation-partner-to-support-world-food-programme-and-the-global-covid-19-response/). Some 40 flights carried PPEs plus other essential medical supplies and humanitarian items, to various points in Asia and the Pacific.


      As demand for pre-travel testing increased, we connected our digital credentials technology company, [Affinidi](https://www.affinidi.com/), with global aviation industry partners and government agencies. The company has since [formed partnerships](https://www.affinidi.com/blogs/affinidi-the-commons-project-partnership) with industry leaders in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific, to enable safe cross-border travel solutions with mobile digital verification of health credentials including test and vaccination status.

    title: Steering through Volatility

      Major economies are now starting to relax lockdown measures, as vaccination brings some early successes. Growth could be strong this year and next.


      The pace of recovery will likely be uneven across countries. Many emerging economies are still struggling with new peaks of infections, high hospitalisation numbers and slow vaccination rates. Uncertainty still remains, not least from the doubly contagious new variants, with potentially worse virulence.


      In the US, the quick vaccination pace has cooled down infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Activities are normalising swiftly. [Extraordinary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/) [fiscal](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3548/text) [stimulus](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/133/text) and [accommodative Fed policy](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616c.htm) will bolster this recovery. Real Gross Domestic Product is expected to return to pre-COVID levels this year, though inflation [risks](http://localhost/investor/how-we-manage-risks.html) may dampen medium term prospects.


      Europe has entered into a double-dip recession in the first quarter of 2021. However, the accelerated vaccine rollout and the consequent easing of restrictions are now facilitating a recovery in activity, especially in the services and tourism sectors. The pandemic lockdowns built up excess savings. This will fuel pent-up demand to spur a pickup in consumption growth. The [Recovery Fund](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en) will stimulate investments later this year.


      [China’s economic recovery](http://english.www.gov.cn/news/topnews/202106/17/content_WS60ca83a8c6d0df57f98db60b.html) continues apace. Its focus is shifting towards sustainable growth for the longer term. The very loose policy stance during the pandemic is being pulled back into a broadly neutral gear. Any further policy tightening is more likely to be [calibrated](http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/202105/13/content_WS609c7adac6d0df57f98d96de.html) than abrupt.


      Singapore’s economy is [on the mend](https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2021/05/MTI-Maintains-2021-GDP-Growth-Forecast-at-4_0-to-6_0-Per-Cent). Sectors such as manufacturing, and professional, financial, and technological services, continue to show strength. However, recovery in other sectors such as travel and leisure, will be muted and vulnerable to any resurgences in community infections. Policy remains [accommodative](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2021/mas-monetary-policy-statement-14apr21) overall. [Fiscal support](https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/covid-19) remains targeted at sectors most impacted by ongoing border restrictions or renewed safe management measures. [Policies](https://www.mof.gov.sg/singaporebudget) and [efforts](https://emergingstronger.sg/) to accelerate restructuring and transformation should position Singapore well in the medium term.


      We should expect COVID-19 to become endemic, and prepare to live with it.
