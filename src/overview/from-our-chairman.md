intro: Two issues will greatly impact our lives in the years ahead — the
  COVID-19 pandemic, and global warming.

      Successive waves of COVID-19 outbreaks peaked higher and higher, for most
      of 2020 and well into the first half of 2021. Lives and livelihoods were
      devastated around the world. The unexpected early successes of COVID-19
      vaccines offered a ray of hope, clouded by production capacity
      constraints. However, the more infectious new variants of concern are now
      threatening to outpace vaccination deliveries.


      Even as Temasek shouldered its part in [various pandemic initiatives](http://localhost/steward/rising-above-covid-19.html), we kept a full agenda as an [investor, institution and steward](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/who-we-are/our-charter).


      Looking ahead, we expect policymakers to remain accommodative. [Global growth may touch 6% in 2021 after the -3.3% decline in 2020](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/03/23/world-economic-outlook-april-2021).


      The pandemic has exacerbated the ongoing US-China strategic rivalry. This geopolitical uncertainty will be a drag on the investment climate and economic confidence.


      Other longer term global threats have not gone away. The window is closing rapidly on the carbon abatement front. We are [nearing the tipping point](http://localhost/pathways-to-sustainability/towards-a-sustainable-future.html) for melting glaciers.


      Our world has changed. It is not a sustainable option to bounce back to “business as usual”. We must all pull together, and bounce *forward* into a new norm for better lives and more sustainable livelihoods.


      The world came together to deliver solutions to the pandemic threat, however untidy the politics and fractious the nationalistic urges. We can and must do the same to [reduce carbon emissions](http://localhost/pathways-to-sustainability/measuring-and-tracking-portfolio-emissions.html), and improve food, water, energy and waste management.


      Temasek can work to catalyse solutions to key global challenges. We will deploy *[financial capital](http://localhost/overview/our-financials-and-portfolio.html)* to stimulate innovation and growth; develop *[human capital](http://localhost/overview/onetemasek-our-people.html)* to uplift capabilities and enhance potential; enable *[natural capital](http://localhost/overview/towards-a-net-zero-world.html)* to foster sustainable solutions for the climate and a better living environment; and crowd in *[social capital](http://localhost/overview/uplifting-lives-and-communities.html)* to transform lives for a more inclusive and resilient world.
